// Purpose: Interface to creating a new steam instance, or to
//			connect to an existing steam instance, whether it's in a
//			different process or is local.
//
//			For most scenarios this is all handled automatically via SteamAPI_Init().
//			You'll only need to use these interfaces if you have a more complex versioning scheme,
//			where you want to get different versions of the same interface in different dll's in your project.
